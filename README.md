## Dataset

The Telco customer churn dataset contains information about a fictional telco company that provided home phone and Internet services to 7043 customers in California in Q3. It indicates which customers have left, stayed, or signed up for their service. Multiple important demographics are included for each customer, as well as a Satisfaction Score, Churn Score, and Customer Lifetime Value (CLTV) index. It is designed to facilitate analysis of customer behavior and retention strategies..

## Objective

The goal of this project is to explore customer retention, churn, and financial performance metrics across different demographics and locations for a TELCO company. By analyzing various factors, such as customer age, gender, contract type, and geographical distribution, this study aims to uncover key trends, patterns, and insights that can inform customer retention strategies, reduce churn, and improve financial outcomes.

## Steps Involved

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis

- Conducted descriptive statistics to understand the distribution of customers by age, gender, and city.
- Generated insights about the customer base and identified trends in customer demographics across various age groups and genders.

### 2. Churn Analysis

- Transformed churn-related data for consistency and analyzed customer churn behavior.
- Identified age groups with the highest churn rates and investigated churn by contract type, location, and reasons for churn.
- Analyzed churn behavior by location, identifying cities with the highest churn in California.
- Categorized churn reasons into meaningful groups such as "Poor Customer Service", "High Cost", and "Superior Competitor Offerings" for more focused analysis.
- Investigated high-value customers (with high CLTV) who churned, to understand potential risks to customer retention.

### 3. Revenue Analysis

- Analyzed revenue per customer by contract type and identified the highest revenue-generating customers.
- Investigated which locations (cities) generated the most revenue, helping the company focus on areas with high financial performance.

## Key Findings

- Customer churn is notably higher in certain age groups and contract types, suggesting that specific demographics are more at risk.
- Service-related issues, high costs, and superior competitor offerings are common reasons behind customer churn.
- Financial performance varies significantly across cities, with certain locations generating significantly higher revenue than others.
- High-value customers are leaving the company, which may represent a substantial loss of potential revenue.

## Conclusion

This analysis provides actionable insights for the TELCO company to refine its customer retention strategies, tailor its offerings to different demographic groups, and optimize its pricing and service strategies to reduce churn and enhance financial performance.
